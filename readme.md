## Regarding the website system 
The website helps anyone to select the places that they want to visit in the given time and give a estimate budget (*on per day baisis) with the information for the accomodation, food, the travel and reachablity to a place.

Currently as the system is avilable with the pre embeded data so we have covered the places from the Maharashtra and popular places only.
